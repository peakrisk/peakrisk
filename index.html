<p>This project will use open data, open science and open source to
create risk models that can be used for environmental impact
assessments and strategic planning.</p>
<p>There will be a focus on hurricane and cyber risk.  However, the long
term goal is to produca a model that can be used for comprehensive
risk assessment and forecasting.</p>
<p>Based in Bermuda, the hurricane project will use sources of open data
to help build a Bermudian hurricane model.</p>
<p>The techniques and software used will be translatable to other areas
and should be applicable throughout the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The project also aims to develop open communities in Bermuda and to
generate ties with others doing similar work elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is inspired by the magnificent work of the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#python">python</a> community.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-peak-risk">
<h2>Why Peak Risk?</h2>
<p>I grew up close to the Peak District, a national park in the UK,
between Sheffield and Manchester.   It was a great area for walking,
hiking, climbing, caving, cycling and many other outdoor activities.</p>
<p>So we have <em>peak</em>.  Naming projects after mountains and hills, that
makes naming fun.  For starters, there is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdon">Mount Snowdon</a>.  The
highest mountain in Wales.  But only one letter difference from
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a>.</p>
<p>Cyber risk and <em>privacy</em> will both be a focus of the project.</p>
<p>The world is changing faster than at any time in my life.  There has
been a lot of change in that time.  We are faced with global crises
such as that of climate change.  In many ways the world could be
viewed as being at <em>peak risk</em>.</p>
<p>It is also a time of incredible opportunity for humanity.  I believe
that by free and open sharing of our knowledge, data and skills we can
move the world in a good direction.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#python">python</a> community has been a huge inspiration to start this
project and thanks go out to all involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="models">
<h2>Models</h2>
<p>Peak Risk will focus on local models, looking in detail at particular
regions or risks.</p>
<p>However, the aim will be to work with open formats and standards and
to help develop those standards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>There are large amounts of very interesting data sets becoming widely
available.  A challenge is the sheer volume of separate sources of
information and the rate at which it is growing.</p>
<p>There are some signs of consolidation and standards and software used
across boundaries.  Certainly, the same data science tools are being
used in a wide variety of applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cyber-risk">
<h2>Cyber Risk</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="stories/snowdon.rst">Snowdon</a> is the highest mountain in Wales.  It is also intended
as a reference to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a>.  There is a one letter garble,
but these things happen.</p>
<p>It is not possible to understand cyber risk without an appreciation of
the material that Snowden revealed to the world.</p>
<p>He has shown how completely broken cyber security is in the modern
world.  Laura Poitras' documentary, CitizenFour, winner of the best
documentary Oscar in 2015, is an excellent account, filmed as Edward
Snowden was in Hong Kong uncertain of his future.  The film is also an
excellent <em>cyber security 101</em> guide.</p>
<p>There is currently a great deal of uncertainty about the future, which
makes this a fascinating area for study.  Cyber risk is a complex
subject, how this world evolves will be determined by a complex
mixture of legal, governmental, social and technical developments.</p>
<p>The whole area is also inextricably linked to privacy.  There is a
public debate about who should have access to just what data.</p>
<p>Increasingly, governments are introducing freedom of information
acts.  In the computer age, the costs of making information not only
available, but also freely searchable are negligible.</p>
<p>Some governments are trying to use legal and other means to prevent
the general public from having secure communications.  So, the
governments want to be able to collect our own communications but are
less keen on transparency on their own actions.</p>
<p>It is clear there needs to be an informed, public debate about cyber
security and privacy.</p>
<p>Within technology communities this debate is actively going on.  The
recent PyCon had several talks about how broken TLS (https) is, as
well as efforts to fix the problem.  There are many working on secure
communication tools, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://protonmail.ch/">Proton Mail</a>.  Others are working on
distributed systems, in attempts to avoid central authorities which
are always a ripe area for exploits.</p>
<p>Companies such as Google have responded admirably to the Snowden
revelations, but are still under considerable government pressure to
cooperate.  Indeed, the Snowden docs showed how they were
cooperating.  Google were rightly angry when it was revealed that,
notwithstanding this cooperation, the NSA was tapping into their
internal networks to collect data as it was transferred from one site
to another.  Google responded by adding encryption to this
communication.</p>
<p>Whatever you think of the actions of Edward Snowden, he has revealed
to the world the truth of what is going on and allowed this debate to
take place.  It is in recognition of this that <cite>Snowdon</cite> will be the
name for the Peak Risk Cyber Risk and Privacy project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="privacy">
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>As noted above, Privacy is inextricably linked to cyber security.
Without strong cryptography individuals can have no real privacy.</p>
<p>Likewise, organisations which store personal data risk breaches of
privacy unless they are able to properly secure that data.  An
organisation that does not have a healthy respect for individuals
privacy is unlikely to do a good job with respect to information
security.</p>
<p>The project will involve much data analysis and care will be taken to
ensure that people's privacy is respected as that data is used.  This
can be a quite subtle problem when multiple data sources are
involved.  Individually, these data sources may not reveal personal
information, but collectively they may do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hurricane">
<h2>Hurricane</h2>
<p>In October 2014 two hurricanes, Fay and Gonzalo hit Bermuda within a
week. These hurricanes have generated much data that can be used to
get a better understanding of how hurricane windfields interact with
the topography and land cover.   The aim is to use data such as
satellite images and aerial photography to get a thorough
understanding of the hazard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bermuda">
<h2>Bermuda</h2>
<p>The focus on Bermuda is simply down to that is where I currently
live.  The aim will be to develop local community and expertise and
together work to build a better Bermuda for all that live here.</p>
<p>The small size of Bermuda makes it an ideal candidate for a detailed
study of hurricane damage.</p>
<p>Other subjects of interest include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>why did two hurricanes 6 days apart follow such similar paths?</li>
<li>could the late intensification of Fay have been predicted?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although a lot of data is available from these storms, finding it,
cleaning it up and analysing it is a time consuming task.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new data sources are constantly appearing. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wunderground.com/">Weather
Underground</a> has a <em>Personal Weather Station</em> (PWS) project and has the
following mission:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Our mission is to make the highest quality weather information
available to every person on this planet. Join our global community
and help us improve weather forecasting.
</pre>
<p>There are currently around 20 personal weather stations in Bermuda
that are feeding data to Weather Underground.  Some of these stations
were recording data during the recent storms.  Wind speed data is
missing much of the time, presumably due to damage from high winds.
Other stations appear to have stopped recording due to power loss.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is some useful data here.  A related project is
<a class="reference external" href="http://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather Map</a>.  This project also has information on how to
build your own weather station.  This would be a great project for a
school, with the added benefit of more data coming on stream.</p>
<p>Both these projects require signing up for an API key if you are
making practical numbers of API calls to access data.  It is hoped
that historical data for research purposes can be obtained in bulk at
little cost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="environmental-research">
<h2>Environmental Research</h2>
<p>Humanity is facing unprecedented challenges such as climate change,
dwindling oil supplies and the reality that we cannot afford to
extract much of the remaining oil without irreparable impact on the
climate.</p>
<p>The project will create models that will allow environmentalists
to assess the impacts of different climate strategies.  It will also
aim to develop mitigation techniques for areas that will be hit hard
by the changes that we are unable to prevent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="community-building">
<h2>Community Building</h2>
<p>The project aims to build community around risk modelling.  When
humans work together, collaborate and openly share their knowledge and
skills they are much more effective in solving problems.</p>
<p>There is a huge open science, knowledge and data movement in the world
today, as exemplified by the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#python">python</a> community.</p>
<p>The project will work to build up open science expertise here in
Bermuda.  It is a natural place for such research.  It has a delicate
ecosystem, surrounded by coral reefs.   It is also uniquely placed in
Mid-Atlantic as a location for gathering weather and climate data.</p>
<p>The ambitious goal is to build up an inclusive community of
environmental expertise using free and open software, data and
knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="development-philosophy">
<h2>Development Philosophy</h2>
<p>This project will build on, and work with, other open projects.</p>
<p>It will use open data sources and open science and open source.</p>
<p>The open world is moving very quickly.  One of the biggest challenges
for this project is to be able to complement work that is already
going on.  Just keeping track of all the new data sources and research
is a challenging task.</p>
<p>Traditional, proprietary, risk models are certainly struggling to
include new research and insights into their models in a timely
manner.</p>
<p>Since the project is aiming to reduce death and destruction in the
world there is a moral imperative to openly share data, research and
knowledge.</p>
<p>Hence, this project will focus on working with others doing similar
work and creating open data standards as well as open source
software.</p>
<p>At the same time it will do local research, using advantage of local
expertise and skills.   Ideas will be generalised so they can be
applied in other juristictions and we will actively seek to
collaborate with others wherever they may be located.</p>
<div class="section" id="python">
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>The python language and community has been an inspiration for many
years.  The recent <a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org/2015/">PyCon 2015</a> in Montreal was the biggest ever
PyCon with over 3000 attendees.</p>
<p>The community is actively working to be more inclusive and welcome new
members.  Many of the talks at PyCon were along this theme.  All are
available on Youtube and are recommended viewing for anyone wishing to
get an appreciation of the power of collaboration in science.</p>
<p>Python is widely used in science, finance and education and will be
the tool of choice for Peak Risk projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="naming-conventions">
<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>The organisation name, <em>Peak Risk</em> was chosen partly because it opens
up the possibility of naming projects after hills and mountains.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pull-requests-and-other-contributions">
<h2>Pull requests and other contributions</h2>
<p>Contributions from others are more than welcome.  This is a
multi-disciplinary project.  Indeed, one of the key challenges in
creating comprehensive risk models is to bring together science and
research from a wide range of disciplines.</p>
<p>Pull requests are always more than welcome.</p>
