I have had two simple raspberry pi weather stations running for a while now.

Both have pressure, temperature and humidity sensors.

One I have in the *carefully controlled environment* of my study, the
other is hanging out of the window.

The study one is known as *pijessie* as it started life as a Raspberry
Pi running the Jessie version of Raspbian.

The outside station is known as *kittycam* as I intend at some point
to attach a camera so I can watch our cat come and go.

For a while I have been noticing that the pressure values have been
quite a way apart.  The software I am includes a conversion to
altitude and I find these numbers more natural for me to think about.

The altitude conversion assumes the pressure at sea level is 1023.25
hPa, which is the mean pressure at sea level.

When the pressure is higher than this the altitude comes out below sea
level, when pressure is lower than this above sea level.

As always, Wikipedia has good information on this:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure

For a while I had been noticing the two sensors giving values
differing by about 10 metres altitude.

I had put this down to the sensors not being calibrated accurately,
but also noticed that kittycam was more prone to weird glitches.

Now the glitches I put down to the fact I have one process collecting
data every minute and another process creating a display on my laptop
so I can glance over and see what the weather is doing.  The latter
was just polling the sensor every 10 minutes.

The code does not do anything smart like get a lock and my guess was
that the two processes were occasionally trampling on each other's feet.

Long story short, I decided to take a closer look.

Now the two sets of data have different indices since the processes
collecting the data are not in sync.

So we need to align the data and then fill in missing values

In [6]:
# align returns two new dataframes, now aligned
d1, d2 = data[0].align(data[1])

In [7]:
# have a look, note the count is just the valid data.

So we do have a difference around 5m.  More interestingly, there seems to be some sort of daily pattern to the data.

## How the BMP180 sensor works

The BMP180 pressure sensor includes a temperature sensor.  It also
includes a number of constants stored in EPROM for calibration.

The raw reading from the pressure sensor gives different values if the
pressure stays constant but the temperature varies.

The data sheet
https://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST-BMP180-DS000-09.pdf for the
sensor describes the calculations that have to be made to compensate
for the temperature.

The code below, from the Adafruit code for the sensor implements these
calculations.

In [14]:
class BMP180(object):
    def read_pressure(self):
        """Gets the compensated pressure in Pascals."""
        UT = self.read_raw_temp()
        UP = self.read_raw_pressure()
        # Datasheet values for debugging:
        #UT = 27898
        #UP = 23843
        # Calculations below are taken straight from section 3.5 of the datasheet.
        # Calculate true temperature coefficient B5.
        X1 = ((UT - self.cal_AC6) * self.cal_AC5) >> 15
        X2 = (self.cal_MC << 11) / (X1 + self.cal_MD)
        B5 = X1 + X2

        # Pressure Calculations
        B6 = B5 - 4000

        X1 = (self.cal_B2 * (B6 * B6) >> 12) >> 11
        X2 = (self.cal_AC2 * B6) >> 11
        X3 = X1 + X2
        B3 = (((self.cal_AC1 * 4 + X3) << self._mode) + 2) / 4

        X1 = (self.cal_AC3 * B6) >> 13
        X2 = (self.cal_B1 * ((B6 * B6) >> 12)) >> 16
        X3 = ((X1 + X2) + 2) >> 2
        B4 = (self.cal_AC4 * (X3 + 32768)) >> 15

        B7 = (UP - B3) * (50000 >> self._mode)

        if B7 < 0x80000000:
            p = (B7 * 2) / B4
        else:
            p = (B7 / B4) * 2
        X1 = (p >> 8) * (p >> 8)
        X1 = (X1 * 3038) >> 16
        X2 = (-7357 * p) >> 16
        p = p + ((X1 + X2 + 3791) >> 4)

        return p
