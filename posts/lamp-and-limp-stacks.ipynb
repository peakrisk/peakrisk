    "The company was already running some of its internal modelling on\n",
    "Linux.  It was a natural migration from proprietary Unix that had been\n",
    "used previously.  It worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they were short of free software expertise and understanding.  And\n",
    "the main advocate in the company was sick with an (as yet) undiagnosed\n",
