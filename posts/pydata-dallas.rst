The PyData, Dallas videos are now up on youtube under `PyData TV`_.

Lots of interesting stuff to view there.  So far, I have watched `Luis
Miguel Sanchez`_ talk about modelling insurance linked securities
(ILS) all in `Jupyter`_ notebooks.  Shows how things that used to take
days and weeks can now be done in a matter of hours.

I am also enjoying `Peter Wang`_ talking about *the state of the of
the Py*.
