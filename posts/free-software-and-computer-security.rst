.. description: Security advantages and potential pitfalls with Free Software
.. type: text

I have been thinking much about information security over the last few
months.

Over the years I have thought about the relative merits of `free
software` versus non-free.

Free as in freedom, or logicel libre if you prefer.  Free software
comes with important freedoms.  You are free to examine how it works,
make changes and experiment.

Free software is everywhere, for example, `openssl`_ is used in many
different operating systems.

Your security depends on free software
======================================

Even when you are using non-free.
