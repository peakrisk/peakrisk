.. description: A brief history of me
.. type: text

For the past 17 years I have worked in various roles on risk modelling
problems in the reinsurance industry.  Throughout this time I have been
building systems and doing data analysis with open source tools.

Prior to working in risk modelling I was employed by the British
Government and worked on communications security, including a three
year tour of duty in Ottawa, Canada.

I have been using open source software for over twenty-five years and
have watched as it has slowly become the tool of choice in so many
areas. 

Whilst I have made some peripheral contributions to a number of open
source projects and created some hobby projects of my own, most of my
work has been within the coorporate environment in companies which are
heavy users of proprietary software and catastrophe models.  I have
considerable experience of integrating open source solutions in these
environments. 

Proprietary software and risk modelling platforms are struggling to
keep pace with the work that is going on in open source, open data and
open science communities. 

As such, it is my belief that if you want to take advantage of the
latest ideas and knowledge you need to be part of that community.

It is in this environment that I am starting the Peak Risk project.
