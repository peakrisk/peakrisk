Why Peak Risk?
--------------

I grew up close to the Peak District, a national park in the UK,
between Sheffield and Manchester.   It was a great area for walking,
hiking, climbing, caving, cycling and many other outdoor activities.

So we have *peak*.  Naming projects after mountains and hills, that
makes naming fun.  For starters, there is `Snowdon`_.  The highest
mountain in Wales.  But only one letter difference from `Edward
Snowden`_.

Cyber risk and *privacy* will both be a focus of the project.  

The world is changing faster than at any time in my life.  There has
been a lot of change in that time.  We are faced with global crises
such as that of climate change.  In many ways the world could be
viewed as being at *peak risk*.  

It is also a time of incredible opportunity for humanity.  I believe
that by free and open sharing of our knowledge, data and skills we can
move the world in a good direction.

The `python`_ community has been a huge inspiration to start this
project and thanks go out to all involved.

Models
------

Peak Risk will focus on local models, looking in detail at particular
regions or risks.  

However, the aim will be to work with open formats and standards and
to help develop those standards.  

Data
----

There are large amounts of very interesting data sets becoming widely
available.  A challenge is the sheer volume of separate sources of
information and the rate at which it is growing.

There are some signs of consolidation and standards and software used
across boundaries.  Certainly, the same data science tools are being
used in a wide variety of applications.
