Why Peak Risk?
--------------

I grew up close to the Peak District, a national park in the UK,
between Sheffield and Manchester.   It was a great area for walking,
hiking, climbing, caving, cycling and many other outdoor activities.

So we have *peak*.  Naming projects after mountains and hills, that
makes naming fun.  For starters, there is `Mount Snowdon`_.  The
highest mountain in Wales.  But only one letter difference from
`Edward Snowden`_.

Cyber risk and *privacy* will both be a focus of the project.  

The world is changing faster than at any time in my life.  There has
been a lot of change in that time.  We are faced with global crises
such as that of climate change.  In many ways the world could be
viewed as being at *peak risk*.  

It is also a time of incredible opportunity for humanity.  I believe
that by free and open sharing of our knowledge, data and skills we can
move the world in a good direction.

The `python`_ community has been a huge inspiration to start this
project and thanks go out to all involved.

Models
------

Peak Risk will focus on local models, looking in detail at particular
regions or risks.  

However, the aim will be to work with open formats and standards and
to help develop those standards.  

Data
----

There are large amounts of very interesting data sets becoming widely
available.  A challenge is the sheer volume of separate sources of
information and the rate at which it is growing.

There are some signs of consolidation and standards and software used
across boundaries.  Certainly, the same data science tools are being
used in a wide variety of applications.

Cyber Risk
----------

`Snowdon`_ is the highest mountain in Wales.  It is also intended
as a reference to `Edward Snowden`_.  There is a one letter garble,
but these things happen.

It is not possible to understand cyber risk without an appreciation of
the material that Snowden revealed to the world.

He has shown how completely broken cyber security is in the modern
world.  Laura Poitras' documentary, CitizenFour, winner of the best
documentary Oscar in 2015, is an excellent account, filmed as Edward
Snowden was in Hong Kong uncertain of his future.  The film is also an
excellent *cyber security 101* guide.

There is currently a great deal of uncertainty about the future, which
makes this a fascinating area for study.  Cyber risk is a complex
subject, how this world evolves will be determined by a complex
mixture of legal, governmental, social and technical developments.

The whole area is also inextricably linked to privacy.  There is a
public debate about who should have access to just what data.

Increasingly, governments are introducing freedom of information
acts.  In the computer age, the costs of making information not only
available, but also freely searchable are negligible.

Some governments are trying to use legal and other means to prevent
the general public from having secure communications.  So, the
governments want to be able to collect our own communications but are
less keen on transparency on their own actions.

It is clear there needs to be an informed, public debate about cyber
security and privacy.  

Within technology communities this debate is actively going on.  The
recent PyCon had several talks about how broken TLS (https) is, as
well as efforts to fix the problem.  There are many working on secure
communication tools, such as `Proton Mail`_.  Others are working on
distributed systems, in attempts to avoid central authorities which
are always a ripe area for exploits.

Companies such as Google have responded admirably to the Snowden
revelations, but are still under considerable government pressure to
cooperate.  Indeed, the Snowden docs showed how they were
cooperating.  Google were rightly angry when it was revealed that,
notwithstanding this cooperation, the NSA was tapping into their
internal networks to collect data as it was transferred from one site
to another.  Google responded by adding encryption to this
communication.

Whatever you think of the actions of Edward Snowden, he has revealed
to the world the truth of what is going on and allowed this debate to
take place.  It is in recognition of this that `Snowdon` will be the
name for the Peak Risk Cyber Risk and Privacy project.

Privacy
-------

As noted above, Privacy is inextricably linked to cyber security.

Community Building
------------------

The project aims to build community around risk modelling.

Education
---------

Development Philosophy
----------------------

This project will build on, and work with, other open projects.

It will use open data sources and open science and open source.  

The open world is moving very quickly.  One of the biggest challenges
for this project is to be able to complement work that is already
going on.
