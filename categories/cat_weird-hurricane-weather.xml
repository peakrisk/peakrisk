the 2016 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Alex_%282016%29"&gt;Hurricane Alex&lt;/a&gt; was a category one storm over the Azores.  Wikipedia
has an excellent article on the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm had an interesting history, forming near the Bahamas, before
bringing gales to Bermuda.  It then tracked southerly, south of the
Azores and began to intensify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is generally stated that hurricanes require sea surface temperature
of 26C to form, but the sea surface was just 20C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upper atmosphere temperatures, however, were unusually low.  It is
the difference in temperature that drives the hurricane heat engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have argued that global warming, with rising sea temperatures
might not result in more intense storms if there is also an equivalent
warming of upper atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am guessing that the warming of the atmosphere and oceans will not
be in sync, so there will likely be a period of strange storms such as
hurricane Alex in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An eye feature soon appeared, marking intensification, within a
complex of several banding features. The 20 mi (25 km) wide
feature cleared out early on January 14 and was surrounded by a
ring of −76°F (−60°C) cloud tops. The storm remained vertically
stacked with a cold-core low, though the development of upper-level
outflow indicated the system was becoming increasingly
tropical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite moving over 68°F (20°C) waters, Alex continued to deepen
and transitioned into a full-fledged tropical cyclone by 09:00
UTC. The transition was enabled by colder-than-average
upper-tropospheric temperatures which created greater instability
than would otherwise be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia also states that there was less damage than feared in the
Azores.  I am wondering what the preciptation was like for the storm.
Rainfall has been a factor in damage for some of the recent storms,
together with flooding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://peakrisk.github.io/peakrisk/posts/hurricane-alex.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 22:40:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
